          <p>
            This is a CS 426 Senior Project in Computer Science, Spring 2025, at
            UNR, CSE Department. We started brainstorming different ideas for
            this project and decided to create a tool to help with travel and
            relocation since we all felt that the options on the market could be
            better.

            <span style="font-weight: bold">4/23</span> - We have added in
            support for all services and given predictions on the housing market
            using our own ML model. The cards now all have real images for all
            data retrieved.

            <span style="font-weight: bold">4/8</span> - We are working on
            completing the site by fixing it up around the edges and adding in
            more real data

          <h2>Significance</h2>
          <br />
          <p>
            Embarkr is a worthwhile project because of the concept of
            streamlining both travel planning and relocation. We address
            problems that most people have when planning a trip or moving to a
            new city. The problems are the time it takes to find locations you
            need in the city and the stress that comes from planning everything.
            With the use of AI-powered prompts with the data from the APIs, we
            can significantly reduce the time and effort it takes for people to
            make these decisions. We are also working on implementing
            personalized recommendations based on previous searches/results
            which would make the process of planning even faster.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            From a professional growth view, this project will help us develop
            full-stack development skills which give us a very good chance in
            todayâ€™s market. We also integrated AI components which will look
            good on our resume since AI is the biggest topic in the tech world
            currently. The innovative characteristic of this project is that we
            have travel and relocation features in one application. Most
            services that assist in moving to a new city, or to plan for trips
            are in separate places. This means that users have to visit
            different places to book flights, hotels, apartment tours, research
            neighborhood security, etc. We aim to have all these services in one
            place to make the process easier and faster. Some similar
            applications are <a href="https://www.kayak.com/ask">Kayak</a>,
            <a href="https://www.zillow.com/">Zillow</a>, and
            <a href="https://www.zumper.com/">Zumper</a>. Kayak has a feature
            similar to ours, where you can ask an AI bot to look for flights,
            hotels, and places to visit through a prompt. Zillow is a real state
            app that gives information on houses, apartments, and neighborhood
            data too. Finally, Zumper is an app similar to Zillow which focuses
            on rental listings. What separates Embarkr from these apps is that
            we implement all of these features in a single app while having
            personalized recommendations based on previous decisions made by the
            user.
          </p>

            Embarkr has strong market potential as both a business and an
            open-source project. The AI-powered assistant can aggregate travel
            and housing data, which could be appealing to the big travel and
            relocation industries. Developers can also use it to build custom
            city exploration solutions. Future expansions could be improved AI
            recommendations, real-time transportation data, user reviews, and a
            map that gives directions like Google Maps. Additional features like
            budget tracking and real estate insights could also make the site
            more interesting to users who care about those aspects. Embarkr also
            promotes economic accessibility, safety, and sustainability by
            guiding users toward budget-friendly, safe, and eco-friendly travel
            choices, reducing emissions through efficient planning and public
            transit insights.
