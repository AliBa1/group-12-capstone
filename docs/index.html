      <h2>What is Embarkr?</h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        Embarkr is a web application with a smart AI-driven tour guide, capable
        of helping users with travel planning and relocation. Embarkrâ€™s goal is
        to create a system that addresses the pain and inconveniences faced by
        people when planning trips or moving ,through an interactive interface.
        The AI assistant will be able to guide users through finding the best
        flights for them, a budget friendly accommodation, or the demographics
        of an area. By using our dropdowns or writing prompts to the chatbot,
        users can receive personalized recommendations such as travel
        itineraries, nearby activities, and safety insights. These features will
        be great for both tourists and potential new residents.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Our site has two main ways for users to interact with it to get the
        information they need. The first way is by using our dropdowns to get
        the most common terms people will look for such as schools in a certain
        area or hotels in a city. This makes sure that we return the best data
        for the users needs especially if we add more dropdowns for the user to
        be more specific about what they want which we plan on adding. The other
        way is through the chatbot where the user can ask more specific
        questions such as how many gas stations are in an area then we return a
        message with information on it and a map showing them what they are
        looking for. This way we can cover anything the user needs.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        To develop the site we are using the Django framework since it will keep
        the backend more consistent with the machine learning elements of it so
        it will all be in Python. For the frontend we are using HTMX to add
        interactivity to the site and Tailwind to make it look nice. As for the
        data we are returning to the user we are using APIs from many different
        services for things like hotels, housing, etc.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        To make sure the site is dependable and secure we took steps to prevent
        issues such as SQL injections by making sure user inputs are validated.
        We also run unit tests to make sure functions in the backend are running
        as expected which keeps the reliability of the site high while
        developing it. We plan on running more tests by using the site more and
        letting others use it to find vulnerabilities and improve on them.

      <h2>Going Forward...</h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        In the future Embarkr may be able to include real-time data on weather,
        local public transportation, or even language translation for
        international travel. There have not been significant changes to the
        project scope or features. The team is focused on implementing more
        services through APIs such as flight booking, safety, and walkability.
        We are also focused on processing our own datasets through machine
        learning to give the user better results. We have also talked about
        adding a feature to save details for trips or moving in a cart like
        system that we may add once the app is more polished.
