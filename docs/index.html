      <h2>What is Embarkr?</h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        Embarkr is a web application powered by a deep-learning-based city tour
        guide that assists with both travel booking and relocation. The
        application helps users plan trips, find flights, book hotels, and
        gather critical information for relocations, such as neighborhood
        safety, cost of living, and housing options. Users can input prompts
        like finding the cheapest flights or budget-friendly apartments in a
        specific city, and the AI model assists them like a personalized tour
        guide. By entrusting the time-consuming and complex planning tasks to
        our tour guide, we aim to save users valuable time and effort in
        preparing for trips or relocation
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        The AI assistant will be able to guide users through finding the best
        flights for them, a budget friendly accommodation, or the demographics
        of an area. By using our drop downs or writing prompts to the chatbot,
        users can receive personalized recommendations such as travel
        itineraries, nearby activities, and safety insights. These features will
        be great for both tourists and potential new residents.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Our site has two main ways for users to interact with it to get the
        information they need. The first way is by using our drop downs to get
        the most common terms people will look for such as schools in a certain
        area or hotels in a city. This makes sure that we return the best data
        for the users needs especially if we add more drop downs for the user to
        be more specific about what they want which we plan on adding. The other
        way is through the chatbot where the user can ask more specific
        questions such as how many gas stations are in an area then we return a
        message with information on it and a map showing them what they are
        looking for. This way we can cover anything the user needs.
